## Here are fundamental React concepts commonly used in React projects:

JSX (JavaScript XML): Allows embedding HTML in JavaScript, creating an intuitive way to define UI elements within code.

Components: The building blocks of React, which can be either functional or class-based, defining reusable pieces of UI.

Props: Short for "properties," these allow data to be passed from parent to child components, enabling dynamic rendering.

State: A built-in object for managing component-specific data that can change over time, triggering re-renders when updated.

Lists and Keys: Enables efficient rendering of lists of elements, with key props providing unique identifiers to track item changes.

React Router: For managing navigation and routes, enabling multi-page functionality in single-page applications (SPA).


## I used local storage and all system handling :
For handling data in local storage, the getItem, setItem, and removeItem methods are essential. setItem allows you to store data in a key-value pair format, getItem retrieves data based on a key, and removeItem deletes data associated with a specific key. This approach is helpful for managing user sessions, app settings, or storing temporary data without server interaction, ensuring persistence even after page refreshes.
